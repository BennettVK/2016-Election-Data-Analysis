''' 2016-Election-Data-Analysis
This Project was done as part of a Data Manipulation Course taken while at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 
As a result, some specifications of the project were requirements for the particular course. For example:
1. All code within the Data Analysis Python file are broken into siloed functions.
2. All function returns only include the key results, rather than all analyzed data.
Additionally, because of the size of the import files, they are unable to be included in this repository.
Instead, they are linked in the sources document.
This data is for education purposes only.
